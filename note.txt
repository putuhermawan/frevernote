# create problem note

Guys this is how it worked for me:

1- Open terminal and go to user [See attached image]

2- Open .ssh folder and make sure it doesn't have any file like id_rsa or id_rsa.pub otherwise sometimes it wont properly rewrite files

3 - git --version [Check for git installation and version]

4- git config --global user.email "your email id"

5- git config --global user.name "your name"

6- git config --list [make sure you have set your name & email]

7- cd ~/.ssh

8- ssh-keygen, it prompts for saving file, allow it

9- cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub [Access your public key & copy the key to gerrit settings]
